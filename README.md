A **comprehensive Quality Assurance (QA) checklist** for GitHub repositories —  
helping you maintain **high code quality**, **streamline workflows**, and **ensure robust security**.

---

## 📌 What is a GitHub QA Checklist?
A **GitHub QA checklist** is a structured set of tasks to verify the quality and correctness of code changes.  
Integrated into the **Pull Request (PR) workflow**, it acts as a **checkpoint before merging**.

It helps:
- 🧑‍💻 Developers ensure all checks are complete before submission.
- 👀 Reviewers systematically verify standards.

## 💡 Why Use a QA Checklist?
✅ **Ensures Code Quality** — Well-written, documented, tested, and standards-compliant.  
⚡ **Streamlines Reviews** — Clear framework for authors and reviewers.  
🤝 **Improves Collaboration** — Clear expectations for PRs.  
🐛 **Catches Bugs Early** — Issues are spotted before production.  
📏 **Promotes Best Practices** — Consistency in coding and security.  
⏳ **Reduces Rework** — Prevents post-merge fixes.
